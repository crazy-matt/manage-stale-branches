# Manage Stale Branches

This action deletes branches that haven't had a commit in the last `stale_older_than` days, and suggest branches which could be deleted due to their inactivity on the last `suggestions_older_than` days.

⚠️ The branches already merged to **default** are automatically deleted.

If you set the `dry_run` input to true, the action will just output a preview of what would be done in no dry run mode.

## Requirements

Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An example is available below.

For more information, refer to the [GitHub Actions Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).

## Sample Workflow

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Run every monday at 12 pm
    - cron: "0 12 * * 1"

jobs:
  cleanup_branches:
    name: "Branch Cleaner"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "Manage Stale Branches"
        id: branch_cleaner
        uses: crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches@1.0.0
        with:
          gh_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          stale_older_than: 60
          suggestions_older_than: 30
          dry_run: true
          excluded_branches: |
            origin/main
            origin/master
```
