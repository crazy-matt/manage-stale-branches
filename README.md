# Manage Stale Branches

This action deletes branches that haven't had a commit in the last X days, and deletes the oldest tags.

## Requirements

Requires the repoistory to be checked out, this can be done with the actions/checkout@v2 action on the marketplace.

## Sample Workflow

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0
  - name: "Manage Stale Branches"
    uses: crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches@v1
    with:
      stale_older_than: 90
      suggestions_older_than: 45
      dry_run: true
      excluded_branches: |
        origin/main
        origin/master
        origin/develop
```
