# Manage Stale Branches

[![Release](https://github.com/crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches/actions/workflows/releaser.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches/actions/workflows/releaser.yml)
[![Vulnerability](https://github.com/crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches/actions/workflows/security_scanner.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches/actions/workflows/security_scanner.yml)
[![Linting](https://github.com/crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches/actions/workflows/linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crazy-matt/manage-stale-branches/actions/workflows/linter.yml)

This action deletes branches that haven't had a commit in the last `stale_older_than` days, and suggest branches which could be deleted due to their inactivity on the last `suggestions_older_than` days.

⚠️ The branches already merged to **default** are automatically deleted.

If you set the `dry_run` input to true, the action will just output a preview of what would be done in no dry run mode.

## Inputs

| parameter | description | required | default |
| - | - | - | - |
| gh_token | Provide the GITHUB_TOKEN secret to be used for cloning and branch deletions. Needs read/write access on your repository, so passing the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is recommended as set by default with read/write by GitHub. | `true` |  |
| stale_older_than | Number of days after which branches are deleted if not merged in any branch | `false` | 60 |
| suggestions_older_than | Number of days after which branches are suggested for deletion if not merged in any branch | `false` | 30 |
| dry_run | Run the action in dry-run mode to let you visualise the changes before going live | `false` |  |
| archive_stale | Instead of deleting the branches declared stale, the action will archive them creating a tag "archive/[branch name]". You can later unarchive them running "git checkout -b [branch name] refs/tags/archive/[branch name]. | `false` |  |
| excluded_branches | List the branches you want to exclude from the cleanup process | `false` |  |
